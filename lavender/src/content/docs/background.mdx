## A brief history

Call of Duty: Black ops III released on November 6, 2015. Creative
Director Jason Blundell came at the community with a challenge: an
"impossible easter egg" that no one would be able to solve. Jason was
responsible for slipping ciphertexts into games as far back as World at
War, and Black Ops III was his magnum opus. Throughout the lifecycle of
the game, the Zombies gamemode included new ciphers with each new release.
A community of enthusiasts at the time would race to solve them, many being
relatively trivial. But a handful would later go on to never be solved, even
to this day.

Fast forward to 2024, youtuber <Username name="SkiteInnit" type="youtube"/> published
a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_SOzWnS7is) covering new developments on
Jason's coveted "impossible" easter egg. This sparked new interest in the topic nearly
10 years after the game's launch, and many flocked to his discord server, Skite's Aether,
to participate in the discussion.

Over time, the server developed two main efforts: the impossible easter egg, and revisiting
the remaining unsolved ciphers. At the time of the video, there were 10 unsolved ciphers from
the map "Revelations," one from the map "Gorod Krovi," and one from the map "The Giant".

All of the remaining ciphers were written off as impossible, due to typos, mistakes during encryption,
or hypothesized use of modern encryption (although this is frequently disregarded, as Jason has gone on
record several times stating he does not rely on any modern encryption algorithms for his puzzles).

**478 days after <Username name="SkiteInnit" type="youtube"/> released his video, his community solved one
of the ciphers. You can read about it [here](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/gk12).**

Two months later, <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/> cracked the first layer of Revelations 10,
revealing the use of modern encryption despite the director's claims he would not use modern encryption.
<Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/> was then able to find an old, deprecated PHP library called
"mcrypt" that used CFB8 instead of nCFB. This happened to be the ONLY way to get the Revelations ciphers to
solve, as pretty much all modern tools use nCFB. Due to this finding, <Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/>
dropped a bombshell on February 22nd, 2026, sharing he had solved 7 of the ciphers including
Revelations 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12. All of the ciphers used key "Zombies" and some containd multiple
layers of modern encryption, while others mixed in relatively simple classical layers.

## Where we are

We are now attempting to make progress on the remaining 4 unsolved ciphers, and continuing the effort to solve the
"impossible" easter egg. It is unclear if these Revelations ciphers were intended to be the "Impossible easter egg"
or not, and we likely will need to solve the rest of them to know for sure.

The remaining ciphers are a bag of mixed tricks. [Revelations 1](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev1) is short enough
that it appears to possibly be a key or hash rather than a cipher. [Revelations 7](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev7) appears to
be the only "modern encryption" cipher that has also had spacing manipulated. Revelations 1 and 7 were the only ciphers that did not get
cracked with the discovery of the "mcrypt" library method, raising slight concerns that they might be broken. [Revelations 11](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev11)
is the final purely-classical cipher and there is a hypothesis on the initial steps but nothing concrete. [The Giant](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/tg1) is the only
remaining cipher that comes with a key of some sort, and appears to be modern encryption. However, the mcrypt method does not reveal any new
layers to this cipher either.

This website exists partially as historical record keeping, and partially as a way to quickly access information
about the remaining ciphers. To participate in the hunt, you can either continue on your own or join our efforts
in the <a href="https://discord.gg/dsjVrtYygJ">Skite's Aether</a>.
