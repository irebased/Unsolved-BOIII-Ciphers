## Solution

This was not a cipher, but rather a puzzle to find scrap pieces hidden around
the map. When combined, the pieces come together to form a comic book page that
has had notes drawn on it. The notes are criticizing the comic art work. This is
presumably "Icarus from Mars", a comic that Albert Arlington is trying to get published.
