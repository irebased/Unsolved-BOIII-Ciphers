## Solution

This was not a cipher, but rather a puzzle to find scrap pieces hidden around
the map. When combined, the pieces come together to form a blueprint authored by Dr. Monty.
This blueprint includes coordinates to the locations we visit during the DLC season. It can
be interpreted as Monty's grand plan to defeat the Apothicons and create one sacred universe.
It appears Richtofen coordinated with Monty and took notes, which can be found in
[Shadows of Evil 6](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/soe/soe6).

    A [viral video](https://youtu.be/H_SOzWnS7is) posted by <Username name="SkiteInnit"/> in 2024
    suggests this blueprint is part of an "Impossible easter egg" that former Treyarch Creative Director
    Jason Blundell hinted at in an interview prior to the release of the game. The video sites a former
    developer stating the KN-44 (outlined in the center of the blueprint) had its name changed twice during
    development, with the final name "KN-44" being a "zombies-related" change, indicating a deeper meaning.
