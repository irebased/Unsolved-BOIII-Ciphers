<Info title="This cipher was theoretically impossible!" variant="info">
    This cipher went unsolved from July 12, 2016 until December 14, 2025, spanning 3,442 days.
    Mathematically speaking, this cipher's search space should have made it impossible to solve.
    Included below are some important details about how it was pulled off.

    One major contributing factor was the fact that punctuation, spacing, and
    capitalization have all been preserved in the ciphertext, allowing for crib
    attacks.

## Ciphertext

<CodeBlockWithLength code={
`Rc qipv jhx vld plson fhceuh itp jui gh qhzu dg sq xie dhw. U gbfl lf fluz pcag wrgkv zw, dinyg zw, qge gnvm L fhx.`

## Plaintext

<CodeBlockWithLength code={
`We have won the great battle and now we must be on our way. I fear he will come after us, after me, for what I did.`
}/>

## Solution

This cipher was solved by <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/> using
a tool created by <Username name="WXAudio" type="discord"/>. The initial solve
matched an alternative alphabet. The correct alphabet was found by <Username name="codewarrior0" type="reddit"/>.

This is an Autokey cipher with a custom alphabet, also known as a Quagmire III configuration. The
solve can be reproduced by using [Rumkin](https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere/) with alphabet key
`ZOMBIESAREEVERYWHERE` and cipher key `TRYTHIS`. Set to `Decrypt` and check the box to use the "autokey" variant.

Credit to <Username name="junedgasp" type="discord"/> for discovering a high likelihood that
the tool used to create the cipher was [Rumkin](https://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/vigenere/),
likely resulting in a keyed alphabet.

Credit to <Username name="Lightninghuff" type="discord"/> for rediscovering a launch bug in Gorod Krovi.
This bug rendered in all ciphers in one spot, organized in 3 columns. <Username name="Lightninghuff" type="discord"/> noticed all of
the ciphers containing Kronorium excerpts in the plaintext were in the left column. <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/>
further investigated and found all of the ciphers on the right side were about the great war, and this cipher was also
in the right column.

A discussion between <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/> and <Username name="rebase" type="discord"/> pointed out
the repeated use of "great battle" in the plaintexts, and <Username name="rebase" type="discord"/> pointed out that the fifth
and sixth words would fit "great battle" based on word lengths.

<Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/> used [this tool](https://chesewip.github.io/SolveGKAutokeyCipher/), created by
<Username name="WXAudio" type="discord"/>, to perform a crib attack and eventually found the plaintext.

This ciphertext was the main focus in the Skite's Aether Discord server for nearly an entire year with many
members contributing their efforts to its solution. It was a massive effort for everyone involved -- Quagmire is king.
