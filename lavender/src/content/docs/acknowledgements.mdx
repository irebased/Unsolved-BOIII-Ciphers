Awesome things happen because of awesome people. Here is a page to recognize some amazing efforts.

- <Username name="SkiteInnit" type="youtube"/>: Inspiration, rallying the troops, serious staying power. We would
not be talking about any of this without Skite. He's got us all back on the horse, and every new piece of content
he puts out is like the bat signal. He's ambitious, relentless, and passionate on another level. But in my opinion
his best trait is his honesty and integrity. I have a lot of respect for him.
- <Username name="junedgasp" type="discord"/>: This guy does everything, not sure what else to say other than
he deserves his flowers. He dives so deep on cryptanalysis, he's become nothing short of an expert in a litle
over a year. Going from throwing things together in spreadsheets to generating his own tools and collaborating
with other great talent, and teaching others. Resilience and persistence define him. Hats off.
- The following folks are absolute legends that have never failed to humble my understanding of basically anything
related to cryptography.
  - <Username name="finsternacht" type="discord"/>
  - <Username name="Richkiller" type="discord"/>
  - <Username name="waterkh" type="discord"/>
  - <Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/>
  - <Username name="codewarrior0" type="reddit"/>
- If you want to talk about legends of Skite's Aether, hall of fame has to contain all of these folks too. They
are all very driven to get these ciphers solved, and have been around since damn near the beginning (if not even
earlier). Props to you all:

which compiles a bunch of information on all ciphers. Additional credits for the document can be found in the doc itself.
