## Plaintext

> I am the last of us but I will be joining you soon my friends-cough, cough-death is near. I hope what we have done doesn’t come back to bite this universe in the ass. Thank god we will all be gone because If Monty ever found this place, we would have been in a world of shit. Maybe now with us all gone, the children will truly be safe. -D

## Solve

The cipher is solved by:

1. Reversing the text
2. Performing an Affine decrypt with settings A=15, B=19
