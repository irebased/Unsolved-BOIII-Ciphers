<Info title="Bounties" variant="info">
	These ciphers have accumulated several bounties, accumulating several hundred dollars in rewards.
	To see the latest bounty amounts, check out the cipher-bounties forum in the <a href="https://discord.gg/dsjVrtYygJ" target="_blank"><Username name="Skite's Aether" type="discord"/></a> discord server.

## Getting Started

You can jump right in by checking out some ciphers, or by checking out the
acknowledgements and learning about the hunt!

- [About the hunt](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/background)
- [Acknowledgements](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/acknowledgements)

There are now only 4 remaining unsolved ciphers from Black Ops III Zombies.
- [The Giant](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/tg1): possibly modern encryption.
- [Revelations 1](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev1): possibly modern encryption but also may just be a hash/key.
- [Revelations 7](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev7): likely modern encryption.
- [Revelations 11](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/rev11): the last remaining purely classical encryption cipher that is unsolved.

## The Giant

The last remaining unsolved cipher on the giant can be found [here](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/tg1).

## Gorod Krovi

The last remaining cipher on Gorod Krovi was solved by <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/>
using tooling built by <Username name="WXAudio" type="discord"/> and alphabet from
<Username name="codewarrior0" type="reddit"/>. This is the first of the "hard" ciphers that was solved
by members of the Skites Aether discord server. Solve can be found [here](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/gk12/).

## Revelations ciphers
The ciphers are ordered by the name of their texture file in alphabetical order.

In eary February of 2026, <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/> cracked the first layer of Revelations 10,
revealing the use of modern encryption despite the director's claims he would not use modern encryption.
<Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/> was then able to find an old, deprecated PHP library called "mcrypt"
that used CFB8 instead of nCFB. This happened to be the ONLY way to get the Revelations ciphers to solve, as pretty
much all modern tools use nCFB. Due to this finding, <Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/> dropped a bombshell
on February 22nd, 2026, sharing he had solved 7 of the ciphers including Revelations 2, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12. All of
the ciphers used key "Zombies" and some containd multiple layers of modern encryption, while others mixed in relatively
simple classical layers.

## How credits work

On this website, you will see usernames of people from Reddit, Discord, YouTube, and other communities (ex: <Username name="randomiser" type="discord"/>).
Next to these usernames, you may see a green or blue badge. The green badge indicates the number of times
this contributor was the *first recorded person* to solve a cipher. The blue badge indicates the number of
ciphers where the contributor is credited with helping with the solve in some way.

There may be multiple contributors credited with "solving" a cipher for the first time. Due to the nature of
the work, multiple contributors may be responsible for significant efforts that resulted in the final solution.
We want to recognize this effort. Credits are for smaller contributions that may have shifted or clarified a solution
in a minor way.

Clicking on the green badge will show the list of ciphers that the contributor is credited with solving. Clicking on the
blue badge will show the list of ciphers that the contributor is credited for some effort towards the solution.

<Info title="Credit lmitations" variant="warning">
	Because this site is an attempt to document the history of cipher solves from 10+ years ago
	(as of the time of this writing), there may be some inaccuracies in the credits. First, the
	counts are based on what has been documented in this website. If a number looks lower than expected,
	it may be because other ciphers the contributor solved or was given credit for have not yet
	been documented here. Second, the credits are based on the best information available.
	If you see a mistake in the credits, please feel free to reach out to the maintainers of this site to get it fixed!
