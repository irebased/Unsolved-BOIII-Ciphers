## Solution

This was not a cipher, but rather a puzzle to find scrap pieces hidden around
the map. When combined, the pieces come together to form Richtofen's Journal. This
journal appears to be Richtofen's notes on Dr. Monty's blueprint from [The Giant 6](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/bo3/tg/tg6).
