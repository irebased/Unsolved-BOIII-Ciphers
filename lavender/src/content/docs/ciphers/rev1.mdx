| Location | In a bucket, going from Der Eisendrache to Verrukt |
| Encoding | Base64 |
| Bytes | 48 |

## Overview

This is the shortest remaining cipher. When decoding from base64,
the result is not legible text. This indicates either the base64
was encrypted after encoding, this is a hash, a more complex/modern
encryption technique, or the text needs to be interpreted a different
way.
