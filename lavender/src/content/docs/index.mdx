## Getting Started

You can jump right in by checking out some ciphers, or by checking out the
acknowledgements and learning about the hunt!

- [About the hunt](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/background)
- [Acknowledgements](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/acknowledgements)

In terms of the cipher difficulty, there are two ciphers that are perhaps the easiest remaining,
at least on the surface.

- [Revelations 11](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/rev11) - it is already partially solved.
- [TheGiant](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/tg1) - it is the only cipher left that has a candidate key easily visible.

The rest, despite having interesting artifacts, have had no progress made. So perhaps start with one of the two above.

## The Giant

The last remaining unsolved cipher on the giant can be found [here](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/tg1)

## Gorod Krovi

The last remaining cipher on Gorod Krovi was solved by <Username name="JessesOcean" type="discord"/>
using tooling built by <Username name="WXAudio" type="discord"/> and alphabet from
<Username name="codewarrior0" type="reddit"/>. This is the first of the "hard" ciphers that was solved
by members of the Skites Aether discord server. Solve can be found [here](/Unsolved-BOIII-Ciphers/ciphers/gk1/).
