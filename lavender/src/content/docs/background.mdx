## A brief history

Call of Duty: Black ops III released on November 6, 2015. Creative
Director Jason Blundell came at the community with a challenge: an
"impossible easter egg" that no one would be able to solve. Jason was
responsible for slipping ciphertexts into games as far back as World at
War, and Black Ops III was his magnum opus. Throughout the lifecycle of
the game, the Zombies gamemode included new ciphers with each new release.
A community of enthusiasts at the time would race to solve them, many being
relatively trivial. But a handful would later go on to never be solved, even
to this day.

Fast forward to 2024, youtuber <Username name="SkiteInnit" type="youtube"/> published
a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_SOzWnS7is) covering new developments on
Jason's coveted "impossible" easter egg. This sparked new interest in the topic nearly
10 years after the game's launch, and many flocked to his discord server, Skite's Aether,
to participate in the discussion.

Over time, the server developed two main efforts: the impossible easter egg, and revisiting
the remaining unsolved ciphers. At the time of the video, there were 10 unsolved ciphers from
the map "Revelations," one from the map "Gorod Krovi," and one from the map "The Giant".

All of the remaining ciphers were written off as impossible, due to typos, mistakes during encryption,
or hypothesized use of modern encryption (although this is frequently disregarded, as Jason has gone on
record several times stating he does not rely on any modern encryption algorithms for his puzzles).

**478 days after <Username name="SkiteInnit" type="youtube"/> released his video, his community solved one
of the ciphers. You can read about it [here](/ciphers/gk1).**

## Where we are

We are now moving on to the remaining 11 unsolved ciphers, and continuing the effort to solve the
"impossible" easter egg. There is a belief that the revelations ciphers are Jason's intended "impossible"
easter egg, but there also remains faith that the "impossible" easter egg is something separate.

The remaining ciphers are a completely different challenge from the one that was solved in 2025. The ciphers
with the best odds of being solved are perhaps [Revelations 11](/ciphers/rev11), as several steps have already
been discovered but the remaining steps are still a mystery, or [TheGiant](/ciphers/tg1), since this one comes with
a key of some sort.

This website exists partially as historical record keeping, and partially as a way to quickly access information
about the remaining ciphers. To participate in the hunt, you can either continue on your own or join our efforts
