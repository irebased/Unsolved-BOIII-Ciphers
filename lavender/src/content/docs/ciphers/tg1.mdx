## Overview

This is the only remaining unsolved cipher that might have a key
presented, in `TheGiant` on the top left. It is a base64 string
that does not decode to anything meaningful.

A hypothesis is that this was inspiration for the revelations ciphers,
as many of them are also in base64 or hexadecimal. Base conversions
are part of Jason Blundell's system for creating nearly impossible-to-solve
ciphers.
