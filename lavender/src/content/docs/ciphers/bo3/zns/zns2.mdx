<Info>
    <Username name="certainpersonio" /> noted that they had to modify the ciphertext
    for it to decode:

    > Next you'll notice that I made two changes to the original cipher text. The first is that the third group of cipher text starts "SXZ" and I start mine "SXQn". This was either an error on Treyarch's part or a way to make solving more difficult. By turning the first 4 letters into 3, you tear apart the actual group of 4 in the encoding so it translates to gibberish. However, if you build the cipher from the back forwards you can determine the first 3 letters are supposed to be 4.
    > The second change you'll note is that the very end of the cipher text in the picture ends "ZQ==" and mine ends "ZS4=". In the original cipher text it doesn't terminate in a period. I thought that because all the other sentences they have a period, it was probably an error as well. At the very least, I think it's more aesthetically pleasing this way.
