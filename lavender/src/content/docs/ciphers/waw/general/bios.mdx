<Info title="This cipher required a hint from Jason Blundell!" variant="info">
    This cipher was revealed to <Username name="MrDalekJD" type="youtube"/> and <Username name="MrRoflWaffles" type="youtube"/>
    in August 2015 and again at Gamescom in October 2015 when Jason Blundell asked them about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/NVGMnCwZj7s?t=393" target="_blank">Watch the clip here.</a>

    In terms of time to solve, this cipher would have been available sometime around when Shi no Numa or Der Riese released, dating it
    back to either June 11, 2009 or August 6, 2009. Based on the solution video shaed by <Username name="MrDalekJD" type="youtube"/>
    uploaded January 3, 2016, this means the cipher took between 2,341 days and 2,397 days to solve!
