## Overview

This is the only remaining unsolved cipher that might have a key
presented, in `TheGiant` on the top left. It is a base64 string
that does not decode to anything meaningful.

Based on the solutions to the revelations ciphers that are base64, the leading
hypothesis for this cipher is that it is encrypted using a modern algorithm such
as AES, DES, or similar. The mcrypt method on key "TheGiant" or similar has been
mostly exhausted, so there is something missing preventing this cipher from being
solved.
