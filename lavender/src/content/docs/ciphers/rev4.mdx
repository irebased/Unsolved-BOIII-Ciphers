## Plaintext

> from all of us at treyarch it has been a fun and amazing experience making zombies with you these last eight years without your love and input none of this could have been possible thank you for playing

## Solve

This is an ADFGX cipher. The solve is described by the solver, <Username name="u/waterkh" type="reddit"/>:
> I’m pretty sure u/oxin8 first pointed out (after we had found the ADFGX letters)
> that we had an 8 length keyword (30957298 - I don’t think I’ll ever forget this number
> sequence…). So we started splitting the text into 8 semi-equal columns (This is covered
> in ADFGX Tutorials online (: ). and were still coming up empty. We tried taking out the
> repeating number, we tried shrinking it down to 6 by taking out the zero, but nothing was
> working. After about a week, we started discussing what the Index of Coincidence (IoC)
> would look like for a plaintext of this length. So, after this conversation I started
> programming a solver that would calculate the IoC and then only display a plaintext that
> was greater than 0.054 (which 0.06 is used for normal, standard English sentences, thus I
> was looking for a close match.). I then ran through all the permutations of our 8 length key
> in order to “brute force” our way to solving this. When this didn’t work, I thought I would
> try 7 since in a normal ADFGX keyword you don’t have repeating letters. When I tossed it in.
> Now, we were all under the assumption that we wouldn’t have a non-mixed ADFGX alphabet square,
> so when actual plaintext came out, I was actually surprised. It was a very touching note from
> Treyarch and caught us all off guard.

> There are plenty of tutorials on how to solve and ADFGX,
> thus I’m not going to waste your time. I guess the unique way
> that I solved it was first compiling a list of all possible keys
> (Thanks to a permutation method u/oxin8 created!) and then creating
> a method to calculate the IoC of each plaintext. After doing this,
> I simply used the ADFGX algorithm for setting up your ciphertext into
> columns, then used a standard polybius square to get my letters. I
> then calculated the IoC of the plaintext and checked if it was greater
> than 0.054 and less than 0.074. If it was, then I outputted to screen
> to quickly check if I had something legible. Now, like I said above,
> we weren’t expecting actual plaintext, so the next step we would have
> done would be to toss it into a cryptogram solver and then figure it
> out from there.
