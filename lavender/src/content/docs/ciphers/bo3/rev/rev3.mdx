## Ciphertext

<CodeBlockWithLength code={
`@CB?>?>C@F?A?>CCCG??@C>?@C@C>???G=?C?=C@CGBC@CB?G@A?=CB?C?G<?>CB@C=CB?<FG<?>C>C>CA?B?AGA?F?C?@CA?G=?B?>C@B?`
}/>

## Solution

The original solution found by <Username name="u/pretz" type="reddit"/> is as follows:

1. Reverse the cipher,
2. Perform ASCII to decimal conversion
3. Interpret the decimal as octal, and perform an octal to ASCII conversion.
4. Perform a straddling checkerboard with key `fkmcpdyehbigqrosazlutjnwvx` and spare positions 3 and 7.

<Username name="junedgasp" type="discord"/> was able to find a simpler solve,
which simplifies the approach to 3 steps rather than 4:

1. Base10 conversion based on order of appearance.: `@ = 1, C = 2, B = 3`, etc.

2. Straddling checkerboard brute force, on both normal and reversed encoding:

3. Substitution on the valid decrypt with the IOC closest to English.
